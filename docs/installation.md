# Install zephyr

## In case you already have zephyr installed:

Pinetime works as external (out of tree) application.
You can clone pinetime next to zephyr in the working directory and update manifest and west.

```
west config manifest.path pinetime
```

## In case you start from scratch :

[https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)

the documentation describes an installation process under Ubuntu/macOS/Windows

I picked Debian (which is not listed)
â€¦. and soon afterwards ran into trouble

this behaviour is known as : stuborn or stupid, but I remain convinced it could work

In the Zephyr getting started page :


1. select and update OS


2. install dependencies


3. Get the source code

```
instead of following the procedure:
       cd ~
       west init zephyrproject
       cd zephyrproject
       west update

you should do this :
        cd ~
        mkdir work
        cd work
        west init -m https://github.com/najnesnaj/pinetime-zephyr
        west update
```


1. complete the other steps

to test if your install works :

cd ~/work/pinetime

west build -p -b pinetime samples/basic/blinky

**TIP : sometimes you run into trouble compiling: removing the build directory can help in that case**
