Bosch BMA280
############


.. code-block:: console

      west build -p -b pinetime samples/drivers/bma280 




Overview
********

This sample application mimics the presence of a bosch, bma280 accel sensor.
For this sensor exists a driver in zephyr, but no sample.
Remember, I'm not a zephyr expert and am learning on the way.




Requirements
************

complement the pinetime.dts file with the following (under samples/sensor/bma280) 

.. code-block:: console

     &i2c1 {
             bma280@18 {
                 	compatible = "bosch,bma280"; 
     	        	reg = <0x18>;
     	 	        label = "BMA280";
     		        int1-gpios = <&gpio0 8 0>;
     	               };
            };
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Create a file: `/dts/bindings/sensor/bosch,bma280-i2c.yaml`.
Which contains:

::

     compatible: "bosch,bma280"
     include: i2c-device.yaml
     properties:
            int1-gpios:
            type: phandle-array
            required: false



Building and Running
********************


Todo
****

    - since no serial port and no J-LINK, I have to print messages to the screen (see sample gui/lvaccel) 
    - I adapted the BMA driver so it accepts the CHIP_ID, further registers are subject to investigation, since no doc

References
**********

BMA421 is not a part number available to the general public, and therefore all the supporting documentation and design resources are neither discussed in public forums, nor disclosed on GitHub. 

CHIP_ID=0X11  (so 423 drivers need to be adapted)
