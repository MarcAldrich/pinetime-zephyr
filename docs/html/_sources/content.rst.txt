==================================
::

    this document describes the installation of zephyr RTOS on the PineTime smartwatch.

    It should be applicable on other nordic nrf52832 based watches (Desay D6....).

    the approach in this manual is to get quick results :
        - minimal effort install (pinetime works as an external (out of tree)
          application for zephyr)
        - try out the samples 
        - inspire you to modify and enhance

    
suggestion : 
	- follow the installation instructions 
        - try some examples
        - try out bluetooth
        - try out the display
