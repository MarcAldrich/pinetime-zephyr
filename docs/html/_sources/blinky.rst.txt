zephyr on the pinetime smartwatch
=================================


Blinky    example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



::

    The watch does not contain a led as such, but it has background leds for the LCD. 
    
    Once lit, you can barely see it, cause the screen is black.

    Unless you open the watch, the leds are visible.

    The screen contains three leds, which correspond to low to high intensity.






have a look at the pinetime.dts file, here you see the definition of the background leds.

.. code-block:: console
           $ vi  ~/work/pinetime/boards/arm/pinetime 

           gpios = <&gpio0 14 GPIO_INT_ACTIVE_LOW>;
           gpios = <&gpio0 22 GPIO_INT_ACTIVE_LOW>; 
           gpios = <&gpio0 23 GPIO_INT_ACTIVE_LOW>;




`building an image, which can be found under the build directory`

see : :ref:`blinky-sample` 

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/work/pinetime
    $ west build -p -b pinetime samples/basic/blinky

once the compilation is completed,  you can find the firmware under :
~/work/pinetime/build/zephyr/zephyr.bin
