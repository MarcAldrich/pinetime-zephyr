===================================
Reading out the button on the watch
===================================
::

    The pinetime does have a button. 
    I do not have a segger debugging probe. 
    A way around this, it to put a value in memory at a fixed location.
    With openocd you can peek at this memory location.

Building and Running
********************



.. code-block:: console

             west build -p -b pinetime samples/basic/button


    
.. note::

         #define MY_REGISTER (\*(volatile uint8_t\*)0x2000F000)


         in the program you can set values:
         MY_REGISTER=(read button value);

         this way you know till whether the code executes


a way to set port 15 high (hard-coded of course :))

.. code-block:: console

         gpio_pin_configure(gpiob, 15,GPIO_DIR_OUT); //push button out
         gpio_pin_write(gpiob, 15, &button_out); //set port high





.. code-block:: console

      #telnet 127.0.0.1 4444

Peeking

.. code-block:: console

      once your telnet sessions started:
      Trying 127.0.0.1...
      Connected to 127.0.0.1.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      Open On-Chip Debugger
      >mdw 0x2000F000 0x1
      0x2000f000: 00000100 (switch pushed)

*Note:*:


`The watch has a button out port (15) and buttin in port (13). You have to set the out-port high. Took me a while to figure this out...`
