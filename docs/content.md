# Zephyr  smartwatch framework

```
this document started off in setting up zephyr RTOS on the PineTime smartwatch.

https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php/PineTime

It evolved to accomodate other nordic nrf52832 based watches (Desay D6....) and a Virtual watch (native_posix_64)

```
the approach in this manual is to get quick results :
    - minimal effort install
    - try out the samples
    - inspire you to modify and enhance
```

suggestion :

    
    * follow the installation instructions


    * try some examples


    * try out bluetooth


    * try out the display
