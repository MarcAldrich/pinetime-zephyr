# About

I got a pinetime development kit very early.

I would like to thank the folks from [https://www.pine64.org/](https://www.pine64.org/).

I like to hack stuff, and I like the idea behind Open Source.

The smartwatches I hacked, contained microcontrollers from Nordic Semiconductor.

A lot of resources exist for this breed.

It is an Arm based, 32bit microcontroller with a lot of flash and RAM memory.

In fact it is a small computer on your wrist, with a battery and screen, and capable of bluetooth 4+ wireless communication.

A word of warning: this is work in progress.
You're likely to have a better skillset then me.
You are invited to add the missing pieces and to improve what's already there.

## Todo

list with suggestions:

> 
> * better graphics (lvgl using images and rotating stuff)


> * NOR flash (here one can store data)


> * watchdog


> * DFU (update over bluetooth)


> * acceleration sensor


> * heart rate sensor


> * fun stuff


> * useless stuff, but somehow cool


> * applications, e.g. calculator, cycle computer, step counter, heart attack predictor â€¦
